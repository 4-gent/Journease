## Things to keep in mind
Will be using yarn package management for dependency installations and for running development and production web servers

To avoid confusion when coding, please remember to put files in relevant directories, these may be updated as we go on if needed so keep that in mind

Make your own branches that include your name and what you are uploading to distinguish who did what (i.e. Mj - First Commit)

Please make push requests to prevent commit conflicts.

Thanks guys!!
